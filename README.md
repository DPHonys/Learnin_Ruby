# Learning_Ruby
Small projects on which I've tried to learn the basics of Ruby.

All of the projects are solutions to assignments for the FIT CTU subject (NI-RUB).

### DISCLAIMER: 
I haven't taken the subject at school hence the projects didn't go through any review. There is no guarantee that the 
solutions a correct. I only did them to try the Ruby language.

## List of Projects
1. FizzBuzz
2. Calculator class
